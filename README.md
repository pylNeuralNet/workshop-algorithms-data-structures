# About the workshop
Workshop by me tailored to Transport Network's use-case-specific exercises.
The course focuses on C++20-26 but also modern concepts, because software engineering is something more than using langauge features - it's also designing the whole code in a way to create opportunities for those features to truly shine. 

The most evident business benefit is a secure and performant code that is also readable - and it is an innate consequence of a well designed code, not necessarily code that forcefuly uses some Secure Rules to pass Scans or Test.

I do not know if such workshops even exist but anyways this is how I'd have it. Also I threw in so much that I doubt such advanced modern C++23 course exists in such a form. The recommended sequence is from 1 onwards.

# Workshop prerequisities
- knowledge of intermediate C++ and OOP
- knowledge of C++11-14, C++17 language features
- knowledge of multithreading (knowledge of multithreading design patterns good to have)
- basic knowledge of GoF design patterns
- knowledge of Algorithms & Data structures
- knowledge of principles like SOLID, MISRA, SEI CERT
- prior knowledge of the foundations of Computer Science like Mathematical Linguistics, Theory of Computation, Theory of Complexity, CPU Architecture and Compiler Techniques is not necessary as elements of those, if present in the course, will be explained. Isn't that cool?

And that's it! These Workshops, listed below, expand the basic knowledge listed above like trifolds.

# Workshop portfolio 
(each is a separate course)

1. Algorithms & Data Structures for a multi-threaded environment
    - classic Computer Science problems expanded into more complex medium- and hard-level problems that require to combine algorithmics with GoF Design Patterns and/or other modern techniques (such as those of which consist the other Workshop in the Portfolio).
    - data structures that aren't as common as a hash map, purposely to get used to perhaps sometimes better solutions or revise knowledge. And everything is tailored to a real life situation.
    - For now:
        - multimap
        - interval map

2. Modern C++ design techniques and optimizations other than GoF Design Patterns
    - RAII but also many more
    - compiler implementation of virtual and what about it
    - I threw in some SOLID etc just to show how this Courses techniques naturally and innately implement good design principles

3. Template Metaprogramming
    - 5 most important techniques with examples ranging from a concept-showcasing example to a complex example that highlights the benefits of using those techniques.

4. The drawbacks of C++ and ways to mitigate them
    - Cpp conference with Bjarne Strousp and the trends of C++ progression (C++26 and onwards)
    - Stateful and Stateless Programming. Stateful Metaprogramming.

For each of those courses I already have the code examples with explanations, but I keep them hidden. I'll consequently make more of them opensource as I work on the structure of the workshops, to make the inter-connections between Learning Effects of each Example stronger, like in inference. Also I don't have a powerpoint of any sorts so I'll need to adjust the presentation to be more fun and digestible.

Other courses:

5. Noteworthy Boost libraries
    - this one I haven't fully conceptualized yet, but I'm considering to make the main Motif of this course to write a modern parser that would allow to add some rules. Oftentimes there is a situation where we need to filter each packet individually, which is incredibly CPU-consuming, despite using O(1) and O(N) libraries. But Computer Science allows to think of very outside-the-box solutions. And while at it, some noteworthy boost libraries could be introduced.

6. All GoF Design Patterns along with all techniques from aforementioned courses
    - Algorithmic real-life-resembling problems that also create an opportunity to exercise modern C++ techniques and Design Patterns. Like the tasks provoke to use somewhat "rare" or complicated or new methods, so that it will become more natural to use them in production code.
    - Abstract Factory, Builder, Composite, Facade, Flyweight, Strategy, Mediator, Observer, Factory - are all ready to be revealed in due time.

It has taken me 1 weekend (24h) to do all of that so I enjoy skipping university classes more and more due to such weekends.

I hope you'll join me in this noble pursuit of knowledge, together we'll reach the cutting edge, and most importantly, exceed ourselves!
