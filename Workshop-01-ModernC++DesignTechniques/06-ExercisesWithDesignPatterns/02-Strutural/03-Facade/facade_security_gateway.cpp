    Explanation:

    The Facade Design Pattern in this use case offers several benefits:

        1. Simplification: It provides a single, simple interface to the complex subsystems, reducing the complexity for clients of the gateway.
        2. Decoupling: The Facade decouples the subsystems from the clients, allowing subsystems to be modified, upgraded, or replaced without affecting client code.
        3. Ease of Use: Clients do not need to understand the inner workings of each subsystem, only the high-level operations provided by the Facade.

    C++ Problems Solved:

        1. Complexity Management: In C++, managing the complexity of interacting with multiple subsystems can lead to error-prone and hard-to-maintain code. The Facade pattern encapsulates these interactions, leading to cleaner and more maintainable client code.
        2. Compilation Dependencies: Direct interaction with multiple subsystems often requires including many headers, which can increase compilation times and create tight coupling. The Facade can reduce compilation dependencies by limiting the includes to the Facade's header.
        3. RAII and Multithreading: While not explicitly shown in the example, the Facade could manage resources (like network connections or threads) using RAII principles, ensuring proper cleanup. For instance, the Facade could spawn std::jthread objects for concurrent operations and ensure they are joined automatically when the Facade is destroyed.
